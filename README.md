# Twitter-Data-Analytics-PowerBi
Analyzed Twitter data with Power BI to graph engagement trends. Created dynamic dashboards with filters based on time, tweet content, and user actions. Visuals were pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts, providing insights into tweet performance and audience interaction patterns.

# Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: Dynamic visualizations like pie charts, line graphs, and clustered bar charts for tweet performance analysis.

Advanced Filtering: Time-based filters (3–5 PM & 7–11 AM IST), tweet word count, odd/even dates, and keyword-based exclusion.

Drill-Down Capabilities: Made it possible for users to view detailed click types in summary visuals.

Engagement Analysis: Detected top-performing tweets on the basis of likes and retweets along with user profile information.

Text Processing: Eliminated exact characters from tweets content utilizing Power Query to have precise filtering on content.

Conditional Visibility: Visually show and hide visuals based on specific time intervals through the use of DAX logic.

Date & Content Constraints: Filters applied in tweet date, impression levels, and tweet composition.

Real-Time Flexibility: Dashboards adapt dynamically to system time to show and hide visuals based on this factor.

# Why This Project Stands Out
This project is remarkable for its intelligent application of Power BI to design time-based, content-aware dashboards that adjust in real-time. It integrates sophisticated DAX logic, text analysis, and interactive visualization to provide in-depth insights into Twitter engagement patterns—making it dynamic and effective.

# Project Highlights
Developed a pie chart with drill-down to display click types for tweets that have more than 500 impressions.

Developed a top 10 tweets chart by engagement, date, time, and tweet type filtered.

Developed a clustered bar chart comparing clicks based on tweet type with advanced filters.

Designed a line chart to display engagement trends, distinguishing tweets with and without media.

Visualized replies, retweets, and likes for high-engagement tweets that were posted during summer 2020.

# Feedback
This internship considerably improved my analytical and data visualization skills. Developing with Power BI on actual Twitter data was useful in learning the finer aspects of filtering, DAX, and dynamic dashboard creation. It was a useful practical experience that bolstered my data-to-insights capability.
